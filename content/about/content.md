## About CrownLabs

CrownLabs is currently **developed**, **maintained** and **operated** by a group of volunteers, mainly MSc students in [Computer Engineering](http://www.dauin.polito.it/) at [Politecnico di Torino](http://www.polito.it), Italy.

All the work is done for **fun** and for **learning**. It is a nice surprise to see to which extent the university lectures are really useful in the real work, but also how much additional work is needed to apply the learnt theory to practice.

**New volunteers are always welcome**, especially because students (sooner or later) graduate and slowly decrease their involvement in this project!

## History

This service was set up in about three weeks by a group of students enrolled in the MSc of [Computer Engineering](http://www.dauin.polito.it/) at [Politecnico di Torino](http://www.polito.it) (Italy), under the pressure of the [Coronavirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus), in March 2020.

This virus [hit hard the entire country](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/italy/); all students were sent home, the University set up on-premise video conferencing services in a few days, and traditional classes were moved into remote lectures.

However, there was no answer for labs, in particular computing labs. How can students practice with their coding labs, simulations, cloud, networking?

The CrownLabs project was set up to answer to this question: a group of volunteering students decided to put their theoretical knowledge into practice.

It was a wonderful ride: creating the team, leveraging the knowledge of different people, defining the objectives, assigning the tasks, a lot of collaboration, a lot of day and night work.

The result was a nice playground for everybody: we demonstrated that with the proper knowledge, team spirit, and a great extent of sacrifice, we can achieve great results in, really, a few weeks.
In fact, the first lab was delivered **three weeks** after the beginning of this project: students of the Local Area Networks subject were the first to play with CrownLabs, practicing with (virtualized) network switches running in the [GNS3](https://www.gns3.com/) network emulator.

And, more important, we gave birth to this project, which may be useful also outside our University.

## Why "CrownLabs"?

In Italian, _Corona_ means _Crown_.
The name _CrownLabs_ is the logical consequence: a project born under the pressure of the (nasty) Coronavirus!

## SIGs

Each SIGs is comprised of different members, with a common purpose of advancing the project with respect to a specific topic.
